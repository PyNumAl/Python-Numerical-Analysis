Runge-Kutta (4,5) Pair by Cash-Karp

This implementation performs local extrapolation which practical results show to be more preferable (Shampine et al, 1976; Jackson et al, 1977).
The 4th order interpolant is obtained by applying the Nystrom transformation algorithm (Sharp, Fine, 1992) to obtain the 
Transformed Nystrom (4,5) pair version of CK5(4). This directly solves general second order differential equations of the form
y" = f(t, y, y'). If the 2nd derivative function is independent of y, then the resulting 2nd order ODE is equivalent to a first order
ODE by the change of variables, u=y', leading to u'=f(t,u).

A two-point quintic hermite interpolant can be constructed from the known values yn, y'n, y"n, yn+1, y'n+1, and y"n+1.
The quintic hermite spline interpolant is derived in terms of the stages, k1 to k7, and differentiated.
This yields the quartic polynomial that interpolates the derivative y' (or u). Evaluating at the midpoint yields a 4th order accurate result.
The interpolant weights are obtained by collecting terms, k1 to k7, of the 4th order derivative interpolant.
